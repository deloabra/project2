# Project 2: My Wellness Journey 

## User Story 

* GIVEN that you have a goal you want to achieve 

* THEN you create an account, make a new goal, and track your progress! 

* WHEN you write down your goals you are much more likely to achieve them

* WHEN you write down your goals you are forced to clarify what you want 

* YOU will be motivated to take action 

* YOU will be able to see and celebrate your progress! 

## Application functionality 

* Uses a Node and Express server

* backed by a MySQL database 

* Utilizes both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data

* Deployed using Heroku (with data)

* Uses Bulma as our CSS framework 

* Follows MVC paradigm

* Uses Handlebars.js
